						<h5>Batman Tic-Tac-Toe</h5>
						<p>
						<b>The Project:</b> This project started out as a simple two player game. The goal was to make something fun that I could show off to friends and family. After accomplishing my initial goals,
						I felt like this project could really be taken up a notch. Tic-tac-toe has long been proven to be a zero-sum game. This means with perfect play on both sides the result will always be a tie.
						My new goal for this project was to see if I could implement an A.I. and make it unbeatable.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>My role:</b> I was the sole creater and developer of this project. After getting my bearing down with the initial part of the game I had a fully functioning app that could detect wins,
							losses and ties. In order to move forward and create a fully functional computer opponent I had to step back and really think about all of the new challenges I had to deal with. <br><br>
						  For my tic-tac-toe game I decided to use
							a heuristic approach. Because the game has already been proven to be unbeatable I knew there had to be an optimal strategy for a human player. I began to my research into optimal play strategies
							(yes, I actually studied tic-tac-toe strategy). It turns out that the optimal outcome is decided by the second move of the defending player. If the first player is able to control the center and
							a corner then the opposing player can be forced to lose. I designed my algorithm to take full advantage of this. <br><br>
							By programming the computer opponent to play perfect strategy on the first two moves I could guarantee that it would never lose as long as it always blocked the player from making a tic-tac-toe.
							From there I used a series of heuristics to check for optimal moves and instants wins. With a little studying and some careful programming I was able to accomplish my goal of creating an unbeatable
							computer opponent.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Result</b> This is a project that I still have fun showing off to people. It's always fun to ask someone to challenge my app and see the smile on their face as they are trying to beat
							computer opponent. As of this day no one has beaten it yet.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Tech used:</b> jQuery, Vanilla Javascript, CSS
