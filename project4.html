						<h5>Sudoku Solver</h5>
						<p>
						<b>The Project:</b> Everyone who knows me knows that I love a good puzzle. I have spent countless hours doing Sudoku puzzles and have always enjoyed the challenge they provide.
						One day as I was doing my daily puzzle I came up with the idea of combining my two passions, programming and puzzles. Being a logic puzzle, Sudoku really lends itself to programming in
						a way that not many other puzzles do. My new goal? I had to make a Sudoku Solver.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>My role:</b> This was a solo project. Once I decided to make a Sudoku solver I then needed to figure out how to actually make it work. I knew that there had to be other solvers out there
							so I began to search for ideas. Shortly after beginning my search I kept seeing this thing called recursion. Wow! A whole new world just opened up to me that I never even dreamed of. Using a
							recursive algorithm I could take giant problems and make them smaller and smaller until they become small enough to solve easily. I decided to use a method called recursive backtracking to solve my
							Sudoku puzzles.
						<p>
							<b>Result:</b> The result of all my efforts was a fully functioning Sudoku solver and an an awesome journey into the world of recursive algorithms.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Tech used:</b> Javascript, jQuery, CSS
