						<b>The Project:</b> This project is a demo we put together for a potential client who wanted to start a business buying used electronics. This site needed to be dynamic and capable of being managed without the help of a full time web developer.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>My role:</b> For this project I was knee deep in back end code. I was in charge of creating the admin panel.  Due to our client's need to be able to update inventory on a constant basis without needing to have a developer on site
							my primary concern throughout the project was structuring the data in a way to make this possible. <br><br>
							I started by making a few mockups and running through how the site needed to function. This allowed me to see in a visual manner the data I was dealing with and how it needed to be organized. I quickly realized that I was going to be
							accessing data by moving from category to subcategory, or one level to another. This type of relationship led very naturally to a tree structure. I couldn't have a sub-category without a higher level category to attach it to. Now that
							I knew what kind of data structure I was dealing with it was time to begin coding. <br><br>
							For the most part the coding ended up being pretty straight forward. As long as I kept the data structure in mind and made sure that it stayed intact with whatever calls I made to the database things moved along nicely. As the project moved
							forward and we began to think about performance issues the queries grew more and more complex. Because we wanted the site to be fast from a user stand point it was important to limit the constant need for calls to the server. In the end, the project ended
							be a lot of work but it was totally worth it.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Result</b> The result here was far greater than any of us expected it to be. For such a small app this thing really packs in a ton of functionality including a fully custom CMS and an admin panel capable of managing a much larger site.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Tech used:</b> NodeJS, MongoDB, AngularJS, ExpressJS, Angular, Github
